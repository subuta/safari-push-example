### Prerequisites

- [Active Membership of iOS Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/overview/4579AZ8Q4Z)
- `openssl` can be installed by `brew install openssl`
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for serve https server easily with valid ssl certificate :)
  - Run `npm start` will also serve https pages(with self-signed pem) at `https://localhost:5001`, But that won't work with Safari Push Notification...

> Important: Make sure that your web server is using a real certificate issued from a Certificate Authority, not a self-signed certificate. If your certificate is self-signed, push notifications wonâ€™t reach your users.
